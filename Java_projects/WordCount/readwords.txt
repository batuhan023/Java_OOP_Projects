So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are 
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours we live it our way
ALl these words O don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you 
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view 
And nothing ele matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
